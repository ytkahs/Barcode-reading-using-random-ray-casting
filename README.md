# Barcode-reading-using-random-ray-casting
Developed an algorithm to detect and decode barcodes using ray casting and eigenvector analysis - Implemented preprocessing, binarization (Otsu), and signal extraction for decoding EAN-13 codes - Designed an end-to-end system in Python for automatic barcode detection and recognition

Highlights:
Detection via ray casting and eigenvector orientation analysis.
Robust preprocessing → binarization (Otsu) → 1D signal extraction → digit decoding.
Handles imperfect lighting and mild skew.

Tech:
Python, OpenCV, NumPy
